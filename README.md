KnowYourCat
The KnowYourCat protocol is a blockchain-based solution that provides a simple on-chain interface for Web3 dapps to integrate conditions based on address reputation.

The KnowYourCat protocol has various use cases in the DeFi, NFT whitelisting, and GameFi space. One way to leverage the protocol's features is through verifiable credentials.
â€‹
Using Merkle tree proofs and smart contracts, the Binance Authentication Token (BAB) can be replicated on other blockchains like Polygon, providing DeFi platforms with a way to leverage Binance's KYC token at the smart contract level. This can be accomplished by verifying a user's Binance KYC information and using it to mint a custom NFT on the target blockchain, which can then be used as proof of KYC compliance. 
By integrating KnowYourCat protocol, DeFi platforms can automate the whitelisting process for users who have passed KYC on other blockchains, allowing them to seamlessly access and interact with their platform's smart contracts without needing to repeat the KYC process. Additionally, NFT whitelisting and GameFi platforms can use KnowYourCat protocol to implement custom rules and conditions based on user traits and reputation, enhancing the security and trustworthiness of their platform.

You can see an example of using the KnowYourCat protocol to determine the presence of a KYC on Binance with a specified statute of limitations on the page https://github.com/KnowYourCat/knowyourcat-categoryUI-demo.
